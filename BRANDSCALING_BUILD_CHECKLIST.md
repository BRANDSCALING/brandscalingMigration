# ‚úÖ BRANDSCALING BUILD CHECKLIST

This file outlines the strict build protocol for the Brandscaling platform. All developers and agents **must follow** these guardrails without exception.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è MASTER RULE (Copy + Paste Before Any Build Prompt)

Use the Brandscaling Master Rule:
‚ùå No dummy content. No assumptions. No placeholder text.  
‚úÖ Only build what I tell you. Stop and ask if anything is unclear.  
üö´ Never fabricate. Never suggest. Never decide without confirmation.

---

## üîÅ STANDARD BUILD STEPS

1. **Start with the MASTER RULE above**
2. Clearly specify:
   - Role: (admin / student / public)
   - Page or feature name
   - UI components and layout
   - Exact text, labels, links, etc.
3. Request confirmation:
   - Ask: "Show me exactly what you will build before proceeding."
4. Review output before deploying.
5. Confirm it matches your vision.
6. Repeat with next feature or content.
