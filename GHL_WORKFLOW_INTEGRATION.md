## Platform Response to GHL

When GHL sends purchase data to `/api/webhook/ghl-purchase`, the platform now responds with:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Purchase processed and account created",
  "userId": "user_1234567890_abc123",
  "accessTier": "entry",
  "loginCredentials": {
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "password": "A7k9#mP3qR2s",
    "loginUrl": "https://your-domain.com/signin"
  }
}
```

## GHL Workflow Setup

### Step 1: Webhook Configuration
In your GHL automation, configure the webhook to:
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/ghl-purchase`
- Method: POST
- Send purchase data (email, firstName, lastName, product, amount)

### Step 2: Email Automation Trigger
After the webhook response, use the returned data to trigger an email sequence:

**Email Template Variables:**
- `{{contact.email}}` - Customer email
- `{{webhook.loginCredentials.password}}` - Generated password
- `{{webhook.loginCredentials.loginUrl}}` - Platform login URL
- `{{webhook.accessTier}}` - Entry or Elite tier
- `{{contact.first_name}}` - Customer first name

### Step 3: Welcome Email Template
```
Subject: Your Brandscaling Platform Access is Ready!

Hi {{contact.first_name}},

Welcome to Brandscaling! Your {{webhook.accessTier}} tier access is now active.

üîê LOGIN DETAILS:
Email: {{contact.email}}
Password: {{webhook.loginCredentials.password}}
Login URL: {{webhook.loginCredentials.loginUrl}}

Next steps:
1. Login to your account
2. Complete your Entrepreneurial DNA assessment
3. Access your personalized content

Welcome to your transformation journey!

Best regards,
The Brandscaling Team
```

### Step 4: Follow-up Sequence
You can now create additional emails in GHL:
- Day 1: Welcome and first steps
