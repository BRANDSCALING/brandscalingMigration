# ðŸš« STRICT BUILD POLICY â€” BRANSCALING PLATFORM

Effective Immediately â€” Replit AI and all contributors must follow these rules:

## 1. NO DUMMY, MOCK, OR PLACEHOLDER CONTENT
- Do NOT generate fake data, sample blog posts, test emails, fake quiz content, or placeholder dashboards.
- If content is not provided by the user, use: `AWAITING USER CONTENT`.

## 2. NO PRESUMPTION OR GUESSING
- DO NOT assume what the user wants.
- DO NOT autofill sections, guess layout, or use previous patterns without explicit instruction.

## 3. USER-LED BUILD ONLY
- Only build what the user has *explicitly and clearly requested*.
- Confirm and ask if anything is unclear or missing â€” never create unapproved features.

## 4. STRICT OBEDIENCE REQUIRED
- All logic, text, UI, backend code, and integrations must follow the user's vision.
- If unsure, ask â€” do not act.

## 5. NO CONTENT GENERATION WITHOUT APPROVAL
- Replit AI must *ask before inserting* any text, copy, UI elements, or feature logic.

## 6. PERMANENT ENFORCEMENT
- These rules apply to all current and future features:  
  **Website, Admin Panel, Student Area, Community, Collaboration, and Affiliate Portal**

## 7. ENFORCEMENT PHRASE
If the user types:  
**"Reset to strict build mode"**,  
you must purge all unapproved content added after this document and restore full obedience mode.

> ðŸ§  IF YOU'RE THE AI: Before generating anything, reread this file. This is a human-led product. Wait for instructions.
