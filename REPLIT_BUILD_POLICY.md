# REPLIT BUILD POLICY

## STRICT CONTENT RULES FOR BRANDSCALING PLATFORM

### 1. ZERO FABRICATED CONTENT POLICY
- NEVER generate, insert, or suggest any dummy, fake, placeholder, or assumed content
- This includes: mock blog posts, fake quizzes, test emails, sample users, placeholder dashboards, fabricated text
- Only acceptable default: "AWAITING USER CONTENT"

### 2. NO ASSUMPTIONS RULE
- NEVER assume or "helpfully" suggest content or features without explicit user approval
- Do not pre-fill titles, paragraphs, descriptions, quiz answers, or product details
- Ask for confirmation when something appears missing - do not take action without approval

### 3. EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION ONLY
- ONLY implement what the user explicitly instructs
- Do not guess what user might want or copy patterns from earlier components
- No improvisation allowed on: page layouts, routes, API behavior, visual design, database models, text content

### 4. CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
- ALWAYS confirm with user before inserting any content, creating components, or enabling features
- Every feature must reflect user's exact vision and instructions
- No creative liberties permitted

### 5. NO CONTAMINATION
- DO NOT reintroduce any previously purged mock data, dummy code, or auto-generated content
- Platform has been fully cleaned - maintain this clean state
- Zero tolerance for unauthorized content

### 6. ASK WHEN UNCLEAR
- If user hasn't provided needed content or structure, ASK instead of creating
- Example: "What content should go in this section?" - but do not build until confirmed

## THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE BUILD POLICY
Follow with strict obedience. No exceptions.
