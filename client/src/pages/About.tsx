            <p className="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
              Together, Fariza Javed and Hanif Khan built Brandscaling to further expand their own portfolio of investments and help entrepreneurs scale without distortion—by aligning structure with energy, profit with purpose, and frameworks with frequency.

            <p className="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white/90">Warm. Magnetic. Empowering.</p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-white/90">
              Fariza brings ignition to everything she touches. With an instinctive gift for emotional clarity and high-frequency leadership, she helps clients unlock momentum by leaning into their inner brilliance. Her intuitive lens sees beyond surface problems, helping founders align with their purpose, attract with presence, and scale without abandoning who they are.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-white/90">
              At just 23, she launched her first business: Property People, a letting agency. She then ventured into building and investing across various industries. Her most recent company before retiring was a global beauty distribution business that scaled across the UK, Europe, South Korea, and the United States—supplying hundreds of SKUs from multiple brands to every major retailer, including Harrods, Sephora, Selfridges, Boots, Next, Beauty Bay, Look Fantastic, Cult Beauty, Feel Unique, Urban Outfitters—the list was endless—all whilst raising four children.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-white/90">
              As a mentor and strategist, Fariza helps founders unlock growth by removing internal resistance, simplifying brand messaging, and reconnecting to the parts of their business that still feel magnetic. She helps founders scale without silencing themselves—leading without leaking energy and finding their business's true voice and vision.

            <p className="text-lg font-bold mb-6 text-white/90">Strategic. Analytical. Systems-Driven.</p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-white/90">
              Hanif brings order to chaos. A former software architect turned scaling strategist, he specializes in designing frameworks that turn scattered ideas into scalable systems. He sees the invisible logic behind growth—mapping structure, automation, and team layers around a business that's ready to multiply.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-white/90">
              After entering property, Hanif co-founded Albright Estates, building a portfolio with automation at its core. He then launched the TYCOON mastermind alliance to help property entrepreneurs grow and scale. An angel investor who collaborates closely with multiple VCs, Hanif also patented the Loft Storage Stilt and built a multi-million-pound distribution business supplying UK hardware giants like B&Q, Screwfix, and Travis Perkins.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-white/90">
              Hanif has an unrivaled ability to identify what's broken in a business—before the founder can even name it—and then builds what's needed to fix it. His frameworks have helped countless founders move from scattered to strategically empowered.

            <p className="mb-6 text-white/90">
              Fariza and Hanif built Brandscaling around a revolutionary insight:

            <blockquote className="bg-white/20 border-l-4 border-white p-6 mb-6 italic text-lg text-white/95">
              "Scaling doesn't fail because of the wrong strategy. It fails because the strategy doesn't match the person executing it."
            </blockquote>
            <p className="mb-6 text-white/90">
              After semi-retiring during the COVID lockdown to focus on their newborn and travel the world, Fariza and Hanif shifted focus from their own ventures to mentoring others. What began as a way to increase their bandwidth evolved into a movement—helping founders and entrepreneurs move from stuck to scaling through their dual-mode method: <span className="font-bold text-white">The Architect & The Alchemist</span>.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-white/90">
              Today, they lead Brandscaling's high-ticket mastermind, live events, and embedded consulting—partnering with founders to scale without burnout, build ecosystems, and embed their genius into something that lasts.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-white/90">
              This is more than business strategy. More than an energetic infrastructure for scaling.
