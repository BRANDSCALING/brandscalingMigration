  'Master Strategist': {
    description: "You don't follow structure — you design it.",
    longDescription: "As a Master Strategist, you see five moves ahead — but you don't show your hand. You design from a distance, often holding space between yourself and the chaos below. Your strength is in non-reactivity. You pause, recalibrate, and act when the system is ready.",
    edge: ["Strategic foresight", "Calm decision-making under pressure", "Systemic clarity and scalable frameworks", "Pattern recognition that simplifies chaos"],
    risks: ["Avoidance of emotional confrontation", "Delayed action due to overplanning", "Isolation from team or creative partners"],
    complement: "Visionary Oracle",
    icon: "🎯"
  },
  'Systemised Builder': {
    description: "You don't chase momentum — you build it, brick by brick.",
    longDescription: "You are the builder behind many visible wins — but you don't seek the spotlight. You execute with intention, break goals into parts, and deliver again and again. Your rhythm is not glamorous — it's sustainable.",
    edge: ["Consistent follow-through", "Execution without burnout", "Clarity in chaos", "High-quality delivery"],
    risks: ["Over-control of process", "Bottlenecking due to solo task-loading", "Resistance to flow-based collaboration"],

  },
  'Internal Analyzer': {
    description: "You don't just want to get it right — you need to know why it's right.",
    longDescription: "You are the deep thinker, the system optimizer, the pattern master. You crave precision — but not just in action. In logic. In reasoning. In why. You observe everything. You spot gaps others overlook.",
    edge: ["Unparalleled depth, logic, foresight", "Operational excellence", "Design precision", "Intellectual rigour"],
    risks: ["Taking too long to move", "Over-perfecting when something needs shipping", "Isolation when overwhelmed"],

    icon: "🧩"
  },
  'Ultimate Architect': {
    description: "You don't move often — but when you do, everything moves with you.",
    longDescription: "You are the master of operational patterning. Your mind doesn't generate images — it composes frameworks. You delegate with ease, make fast pivots without losing your frame, and optimize in silence.",
    edge: ["High-speed pattern recognition", "Strategic MVP execution", "Frameworks that scale under pressure", "Calm clarity in complex spaces"],
    risks: ["May overcalculate and miss fast windows", "May under-communicate due to assumed clarity", "May resist collaborative chaos"],

  'Visionary Oracle': {
    description: "You don't build what exists — you channel what's never been seen.",
    longDescription: "The Visionary Oracle doesn't follow trends — they download them from the future. Your ideas come fast, fully formed, and breathtaking — but building them often feels like working backwards.",
    edge: ["Wildly original visions", "Rapid-fire downloads", "Intuitive understanding of future needs", "Creative magnetism"],
    risks: ["Stalling after idea surge fades", "Overwhelm from trying to build alone", "Perfection paralysis"],

  'Magnetic Perfectionist': {
    description: "You don't polish to impress — you refine until it feels right.",

    edge: ["Emotional refinement", "Polished delivery that feels felt", "Natural taste for alignment", "Creative authority"],
    risks: ["Stalling when something isn't aligned", "Over-tweaking past usefulness", "Hiding behind the work"],

  'Energetic Empath': {
    description: "You don't push to progress — you feel your way forward.",
    longDescription: "You don't just feel energy — you absorb it. You can sense what others miss. You create from vibration, not plans. When you learn to filter — not absorb — your power becomes magnetic.",
    edge: ["Deep intuitive intelligence", "Natural energetic alignment", "Sensitive creation that resonates", "Vision that speaks to undercurrent"],
    risks: ["Taking on others' emotional weight", "Stopping when overwhelmed", "Avoiding structure", "Losing clarity in noisy environments"],

    description: "You don't just follow energy — you master it, systemise it, and scale it.",

    edge: ["Energy + logic harmony", "Emotional attunement and structural control", "Ability to lead intuitive teams", "Deep internal rhythm with flexible structure"],

    description: "You don't feel clear — because you've been trained to override your truth.",

  'Performer': {
    description: "You don't feel clear — because you've been too busy playing a role to hear yourself.",

  'Self-Forsaker': {
    description: "You don't feel clear — because you've been trained to override your truth.",
