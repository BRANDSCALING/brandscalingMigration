## Changelog

Changelog:
- June 29, 2025. AUTHENTIC Q13-Q18 COMPLETE WITH ANALYSIS TRANSITIONS: Successfully implemented complete authentic Q13-Q18 questions from user's provided document, eliminating ALL placeholder content in this critical section. Added professional AnalysisBlock component that displays after Q6, Q12, and Q18 providing smooth quiz flow transitions with proper analysis stages (awareness → subtype → validation). All authentic content now verified across the entire Q13-Q18 range with exact question text, answer options, and DNA type mappings from user's documents.
- June 29, 2025. EMOJIS REMOVED: Removed all emojis from 12 DNA subtype profiles at user request. All subtype names now display cleanly without emoji icons while maintaining authentic core identity descriptions, operating loops, edges, risks, and next steps.
- June 29, 2025. AUTHENTIC Q19-Q22 VALIDATION QUESTIONS IMPLEMENTED: Replaced all fake dummy validation questions with your exact authentic Q19-Q22 questions from provided document. Questions now cover room design, school homework approach, childhood organization, and learning patterns. Each question maps to specific subtypes (Energetic Empath, Visionary Oracle, Ultimate Alchemist, Magnetic Perfectionist) with authentic insights. Server scoring logic updated to properly handle subtype-to-main-type mapping for validation questions.
- June 29, 2025. CRITICAL QUIZ SECURITY FIXED: Completely eliminated all premature DNA type and subtype reveals during quiz flow. Removed "Alchemist • Developed Entrepreneur" header displays and "As a Energetic Empath" question text. AwarenessBlock shows neutral "Awareness Assessment". SubtypeBlock shows "Subtype Assessment". ValidationBlock uses generic entrepreneurial language. All subtype names in quiz options converted from display names to secure IDs (e.g., "Visionary Oracle" → "visionary-oracle"). Quiz maintains complete neutrality until results page reveal.
