I want to build a “Smart Business Builder™” tool for entrepreneurs using React, Node.js, and OpenAI inside my existing Replit platform. Please follow these steps carefully:

---

🧩 FRONTEND:

1. Create a multi-step React form wizard with 10 questions.
2. Each question should have **two versions**: one for “Architect” (logic-based) and one for “Alchemist” (emotion-based).
   - Add a toggle at the top to switch between Architect and Alchemist view.
   - When toggled, the question text changes dynamically to match the selected DNA type.
3. The 10 questions are:
   1. What is your idea?
   2. What problem are you solving?
   3. Who is this for?
   4. Why now?
   5. What is your offer?
   6. How will you make money?
   7. What does it cost to deliver?
   8. What makes you different?
   9. What’s stopping you from launching?
   10. What support do you need?

4. After the user completes all questions, include a “Build My Model” button to send the inputs to the backend.

⚙️ BACKEND:

5. Create a Node.js API endpoint at `/api/build-model` that:
   - Accepts the 10 user answers and their selected DNA type (Architect or Alchemist)
   - Sends them to OpenAI’s GPT using the following master prompt:

“Based on the user’s Entrepreneurial DNA type and their inputs, restructure the following business idea into a viable, simplified business model. Make recommendations for clarity, monetization, and ease of launch. Use a tone aligned to the DNA profile.

Include:
- Audience
- Problem
- Solution
- Offer
- Delivery Model
- Revenue Model
- Cost Drivers
- Unique Advantage
- Launch Priority Steps

Also return:
- Warnings or Risks
- Pivot/Improvement Suggestions
- Confidence Level (1–10)”

6. Format the GPT output as JSON and return it to the frontend.

📋 OUTPUT DISPLAY:

7. On the frontend, display the GPT output with clear sections:
   - 1-Page Business Model
   - Warnings / Fixes
   - Suggestions to Improve
   - Confidence Score
8. Include a button: “Download as PDF” (use jsPDF to format and export)

9. Add a “Save My Model” button that stores inputs + GPT output in the database.

---

💾 DATABASE:

10. Create a `business_models` table or collection with:
    - user_id
    - input_answers (as object)
    - DNA_type
    - GPT_output (as object)
    - timestamp

11. Show the user a “My Business Models” section in their dashboard with edit/resubmit functionality.

---

✅ FINAL TOUCHES:

- Make UI mobile-first and clean. Use purple tones for Architect and orange tones for Alchemist.
- Include tooltips next to each question to give examples (e.g. “Describe the kind of person your product helps.”)
- Optional: Add a brief welcome message with video placeholder for Fariza (The Alchemist) and Hanif (The Architect).
