Create the full homepage for the Brandscaling Platform with the following structure and content.

Use mobile-responsive design with modular React components (e.g., <Hero />, <Avatars />, <QuizCTA />, <CoursesPreview />, <AIAgents />, etc.).

Apply the global branding system already implemented (Poppins font, brand colors, spacing, utility classes).

Each section must use semantic HTML and match the tone: Architect = Strategic, Alchemist = Empowering.

Structure:

1. HERO SECTION
- H1: "Welcome to The Brandscaling Platform"
- Subheading: "Scale smarter. Align deeper. Build what your strategy and spirit agree on."
- CTA buttons: "Take the Personality Quiz" and "Explore the Courses"
- Background: Split-screen image (Architect blueprint style left, Alchemist warm glow right)

2. BRAND PHILOSOPHY SECTION
- H2: "Why Scaling Should Start With Personality, Not Process."
- Paragraph: "You’ve followed frameworks, joined programs, hired experts. But they weren’t built for how you actually think. Brandscaling flips the model. We teach through your operating system — Architect or Alchemist — then map systems, automation, and team structures around it."
- Visual: Vertical diagram — "Most scale → break → rebuild" vs. "We start from clarity → structure → scale"

3. AVATAR IDENTIFICATION SECTION (Grid of 4)
- Title: "If You’ve Felt This, You’re Home."
- 4 avatar tiles with the following:

Tile 1 — 💡 Idea-Stuck Dreamer  
Headline: "It’s all in your head — but nowhere in motion."  
Description: "You’ve stayed up at night with ideas that feel world-changing… but execution feels blocked."

Tile 2 — 🔧 Framework-Frustrated  
Headline: "You followed the map. It didn’t match your terrain."  
Description: "You’ve tried the ‘proven’ methods. Burnout followed. Maybe the frameworks weren’t built for your type."

Tile 3 — 🔁 Mastermind Graduate  
Headline: "The rooms that once grew you now shrink you."  
Description: "You’re thinking bigger than your mentors now. You’ve outgrown the space — but don’t want to stagnate."

Tile 4 — ⚖️ Successful-but-Stuck  
Headline: "The wins are real. The next move isn’t."  
Description: "You’re profitable. But the system you built wasn’t designed to scale like this. Now what?"

- Centered CTA button below grid: "Explore the Right Track for You"

4. ARCHITECT VS ALCHEMIST QUIZ SECTION
- H2: "Architect or Alchemist?"
- Paragraph: "You’ll learn faster and scale smoother once you know how you’re wired. Take the free quiz to unlock your track — and build from your strengths."
- Buttons: "Take the 3-Minute Quiz" and "Learn What It Means"
- Background visual: Personality split or 2-color circle icon

5. COURSE PREVIEW SECTION (3–6 cards)
- Title: "Start With Strategy. Scale With System."
- Subheading: "Every course has two tracks — one for structure, one for presence. Learn in your natural style, or build your opposite muscle."

  - 🧱 Infinite Scaling Method – "Your business’s new spine—layered to unlock long-term growth." [View]

7. BRANDSCALING PILLARS SECTION (C³ Visual)

Make the entire layout modular, reusable, and clean. Use Tailwind or CSS modules if needed. Prioritize responsiveness and clean branding.
