You are building Phase 2 of the Brandscaling admin panel inside a production-ready Replit-based full-stack app (React, Node.js, Firebase/PostgreSQL). Follow the Master Prompt Rules:

RULES:
- No dummy data, no mock APIs, no fake charts
- Integrate only with real data from the existing Firebase/Firestore backend (or PostgreSQL if used)
- All code must be production-safe, responsive, and type-safe (TypeScript)
- Use Chart.js only if `Filler` plugin is correctly registered and configured (no errors)
- Never invent placeholder stats — fetch real values from backend collections
- Use Firebase Firestore queries to pull daily active users (DAU), posts created over time, number of bans, moderation stats, and user growth
- Build modular, clean components with reuse in mind
- Export button must download real CSV data based on admin dashboard queries
- Use React context or secure props to restrict access to verified admin users only

Build the Admin Insights Dashboard with:
1. A dashboard wrapper component with a sidebar and header (already built in Phase 1)
2. A new `<InsightsDashboard />` component inside `client/src/pages/admin/pages/Insights.tsx`
3. Pull real metrics:
   - Daily Active Users (past 30 days)
   - Total post volume (trend graph)
   - Total users banned
   - Moderation % (e.g., flagged vs approved)
   - User sign-up growth (curve)
4. Use Chart.js with correct registration (register `Filler` plugin if using `fill`)
5. Add an `Export CSV` button that pulls current stats and exports real values to a `.csv` file using a reusable utility
6. All charts must use real-time Firebase queries and update on mount
7. Ensure all components are responsive and use Tailwind CSS
8. Assume authenticated admin context is passed via Firebase Auth hook (`useFirebaseAuth.ts`)

DO NOT:
- Invent fake numbers
- Use placeholder components
- Output mock chart config
- Hardcode datasets

Your job is to write real, clean, functional code for the dashboard — fully wired up and ready to display real admin insights for a live production app. Follow all Master Prompt rules strictly.
