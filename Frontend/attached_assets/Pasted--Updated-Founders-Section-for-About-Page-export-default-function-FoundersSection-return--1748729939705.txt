      <p className="mb-8 text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        Together, Fariza Javed and Hanif Khan built Brandscaling to further expand their own portfolio of investments and help entrepreneurs scale without distortion—by aligning structure with energy, profit with purpose, and frameworks with frequency.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Fariza Javed — The Alchemist</h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">Warm. Magnetic. Empowering.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Fariza brings ignition to everything she touches. With an instinctive gift for emotional clarity and high-frequency leadership, she helps clients unlock momentum by leaning into their inner brilliance.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But Fariza’s power doesn’t come from theory—it’s lived.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At just 23, she launched her first business: Property People, a letting agency, before venturing out and building a global beauty distribution business. She scaled it across the UK, Europe, South Korea & the United States—supplying hundreds of SKUs from multiple brands and every major retailer from Harrods, Sephora, Selfridges, Boots, Next, Beauty Bay, Look Fantastic, Cult Beauty, Feel Unique, and Urban Outfitters—all while raising four children.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As a mentor and strategist, Fariza has helped multiple founders unlock growth by removing internal resistance, simplifying brand messaging, and reconnecting to the parts of their business that still feel magnetic. She helps founders scale without silencing themselves—and lead without leaking energy—to find their business’s true voice and vision.

      <div className="mb-12">
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Hanif Khan — The Architect</h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">Strategic. Analytical. Systems-Driven.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Hanif brings order to chaos. A former software architect at BAE Systems (British Aerospace), he transitioned from coding critical systems to designing business infrastructures that scale.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          After entering property, Hanif co-founded Albright Estates and launched the TYCOON mastermind alliance for property entrepreneurs. He later patented the Loft Storage Stilt and scaled a multi-million pound distribution business, supplying major retailers like B&Q, Screwfix, and Travis Perkins.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          What sets Hanif apart is his ability to map the logic behind growth—across sales, teams, delivery, and offers. His frameworks help founders move from scattered to strategically empowered. He sees what’s broken before the founder can name it, explains the problem, teaches the solution in the simplest terms, and builds what’s needed to fix it.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Together at Brandscaling</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          After semi-retiring during the COVID lockdown to focus on their newborn and travel the world, Fariza and Hanif shifted from their own ventures to mentoring others. What began as a way to increase their bandwidth evolved into a movement—helping founders and entrepreneurs at every level move from stuck to scaling through their unique dual-mode method: The Architect & The Alchemist.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While continuing to focus on acquisitions and their growing portfolio, they now lead Brandscaling’s high-ticket mastermind, live events, and embedded consulting—partnering with founders to scale without burnout, build ecosystems, and embed their genius into something that lasts.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold italic text-center text-xl mt-10">
          This is more than business strategy. <br /> This is Infinite Scaling™.
