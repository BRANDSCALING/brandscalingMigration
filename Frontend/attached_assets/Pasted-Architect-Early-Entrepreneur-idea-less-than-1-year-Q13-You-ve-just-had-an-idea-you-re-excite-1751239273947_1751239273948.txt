🧭 Q13. You’ve just completed a big launch. You’re already profitable — but something still doesn’t sit right. What’s your instinctive next move?

A. I obsessively replay what I could’ve done better, even if the launch succeeded.
B. I start planning new content or a celebratory post, even if I’m personally unsure what I feel.
C. I begin adjusting the funnel or copy again — it must not have been perfect if I feel this off.
D. I feel distant and confused — like I’ve done everything “right,” but don’t know why I’m disconnected.

🔍 What this reveals:

A	The Overthinker	Fixates on post-analysis loops regardless of outcome; core identity remains uncertain.
B	 The Performer	Leans into outward expression to maintain momentum — masks internal confusion.
C	 The Self-Betrayer	Tries to “fix the logic” when the issue is actually emotional misalignment.
D	 The Self-Forsaker	Disconnected from emotional fulfillment despite correct logical decisions — core suppression present.

🧭 Q14. You’re revisiting a product or service that used to excite you, but now it feels misaligned. What do you actually do next?

A. I second-guess every tweak I ever made and spiral into fixing things that might not even be broken.
B. I push the feeling aside and polish the offer visually or socially — better optics usually help.
C. I quietly rebuild the structure from scratch, hoping it feels better once everything “makes sense.”
D. I avoid touching it for weeks. The emotional fog is so dense I can’t access clarity or motivation.

Answer	Subtype Detected	Insight
A	The Overthinker	Over-analyses changes instead of addressing deeper misalignment.
B	 The Performer	Redirects discomfort into performance or branding, not internal resolution.
C	 The Self-Betrayer	Seeks structural logic to compensate for emotional drift; suppresses origin mode.
D	 The Self-Forsaker	Shuts down when logic “should” work but doesn’t bring peace — unresolved inner conflict.

🧭 Q15. You’ve just been given two conflicting pieces of advice by respected mentors. One is highly emotional and inspiring. The other is methodical and proven. What do you do?

A. I freeze. I try to follow both at once, get overwhelmed, and end up in over-analysis limbo.
B. I act quickly on the emotional advice — it feels more alive — and justify it later.
C. I build a system around the logical advice but feel disconnected during execution.
D. I delay decisions, tell myself I’m “processing,” and keep re-explaining the dilemma to others.

Answer	Subtype Detected	Insight
A	The Overthinker	Paralysed by conflicting frameworks, trapped between loops.
B	 The Performer	Chooses the emotional route for momentum, then rationalizes for others.
C	 The Self-Betrayer	Implements logic externally but internally detached; suppresses origin structure.
D	 The Self-Forsaker	Emotional processing overrides action; avoids resolution under the guise of “depth.”

🧭 Q16. A major opportunity has just opened up, but the timeline is tight and your usual structure doesn’t fit. What’s your move?

A. I spin up a new plan, trying to blend structure and excitement — but I end up tweaking endlessly and missing the moment.
B. I say yes instantly to keep momentum, then build the logic underneath as I go.
C. I build a structured plan that looks solid on the outside — but I’m emotionally uninvested.
D. I convince myself the timing is wrong and pass, even though a part of me knows I just avoided the chaos.

A	The Overthinker	Looping between order and instinct, results in inaction.

C	 The Self-Betrayer	Operates through logic by default, but has suppressed emotional buy-in.
D	 The Self-Forsaker	Emotionally overwhelmed by potential disruption, retreats to false logic for safety.
🧭 Q17. You’re about to launch a new product, but you’ve started questioning parts of the strategy. How do you respond?

A. I obsess over what’s missing, rework pieces repeatedly, and end up confusing the core message.
B. I go all-in on the emotional story — even if the structure isn’t fully ready — because I want it to feel right.
C. I lock in the logic of the launch but keep having emotional doubts I can’t quite explain.
D. I pause the launch entirely, rationalising that more clarity is needed, but deep down I just don’t trust myself.

A. I start revisiting every decision, dissecting whether I misread the vision or message.
