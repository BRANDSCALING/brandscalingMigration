A founder's complete startup execution system — designed for UK entrepreneurs ready to stop guessing and start building.

COURSE PURPOSE
This course removes overwhelm, indecision, and information overload by giving a complete execution kit — not just theory. Built for dual Entrepreneurial DNAs (Architect & Alchemist), and layered with plug-and-play tools, master AI prompts, and visual walkthroughs.

What Makes a Business Idea Work?
"A business idea works when it solves a real problem, for a real person, in a way that makes you money — and doesn't drain your energy." — Brandscaling Philosophy

The 4-Part Viable Business Idea Filter:
1. Problem: Does this solve a real problem (or deep desire) for a specific person?
2. Person: Do I know who this is for? Can I describe them?
3. Profit: Can I clearly see how this makes money and scales?
4. Pull: Am I personally energized and excited to do this?`,
        architectContent: `For Architects:
- Think about cost, time, delivery model
- Be specific: "productized service" vs "vague coaching"
- Clarify the sales method: direct, funnel, referral?
- Focus on repeatability, scalability, and profit margin

Risk: Over-focus on logic, skip emotional pull
Remember: You need magnetism, not just function. The market is human.`,
        alchemistContent: `For Alchemists:
- Stay emotionally connected — does this light you up?
- Use intuitive language to describe your vision
- Think about brand magnetism: story, pull, resonance
- Don't worry about being "perfect" — just get it out

Risk: Lost in inspiration, forget structure
Remember: Energy alone isn't enough. You need delivery power.`

        architectContent: `Architect Focus:
- Strategic clarity, mental models, visible gaps
- Step-by-step logic, maps, timelines
- When you overthink: Paralysis by over-strategy, fear of wrong steps
- What blocks you: Uncertainty, risk without logic

        sharedContent: `Module 3: Structure & Setup Layer
Build your business on solid legal and operational ground — UK-specific, step-by-step.

Objective: To legally register your business, structure it correctly, and set up your digital and operational infrastructure with zero confusion.

Sole Trader vs LTD Company:

Sole Trader: You are the business. Simple to start. Less paperwork. But you're personally liable for debts.

Limited Company (LTD): A legal entity separate from you. More formal. You're legally protected. Tax benefits possible as you grow.

Feature Comparison:
- Legal Status: Sole Trader = You are business | LTD = Business is separate legal entity
- Setup Cost: Sole Trader = Free | LTD = ~£12 (Companies House)
- Taxes: Sole Trader = Self-Assessment (Income) | LTD = Corporation Tax
- Liability: Sole Trader = Personal | LTD = Limited (you're protected)
- Best For: Sole Trader = Simple services or trials | LTD = Long-term or higher-risk ventures`,
        architectContent: `Registering Your LTD Company (Step-by-Step):
1. Go to: https://www.gov.uk/set-up-limited-company
2. Choose a name (run a check to make sure it's unique)
3. Add company details: address (can be a registered agent), director info, share structure
4. Submit the form + pay £12 fee
5. Get your Certificate of Incorporation via email (usually same-day)
6. You're officially a company director

VAT Registration:
- Only need to register if you expect £90,000+ in revenue per year
- Or if you work with VAT-registered clients or want to reclaim VAT on costs
- Register at: https://www.gov.uk/register-for-vat`,
        alchemistContent: `Structure Choice Guidance:
- Choose based on your vision and comfort level
- LTD offers more protection and credibility
- Sole Trader is simpler but more personal risk
- Consider your long-term goals and growth plans
- Don't overthink - you can always change structure later
- Focus on getting started rather than perfect setup`

Design your first offer — with clarity, value, and confidence

Purpose: To help you translate your idea into a real offer — the actual product, service, or package you'll sell.

An idea isn't a business until it becomes an offer.

The Offer Builder Canvas helps you turn your idea into a compelling offer that people understand, want, and pay for — without fluff, overwhelm, or guesswork.

Offer Builder Canvas Template (5-Part Framework):
1. The Transformation: What change/result are you promising?
2. The Vehicle: What are you actually delivering?
3. The Price: What are you charging?
4. The Timeline: How long does the offer take to deliver or complete?
5. The Promise: Why should someone say yes to this now?`,
        architectContent: `Architect Approach to Offers:
- Don't make it so practical that it loses its emotional appeal
- Ask: "Would someone feel drawn to this or does it just feel like a service menu?"
- Price for profit, not just time
- Include format, time, location, and delivery method
- Focus on clear delivery systems and scalable processes`,
        alchemistContent: `Alchemist Approach to Offers:
- Don't get lost in just how it feels or sounds — get clear on delivery, price, and time investment
- Ask: "Would someone logically understand how this works?"
- Don't undercharge - value your transformation
- Think outcome, identity shift, or solved pain
- Focus on emotional connection and resonance`

Test your idea before you waste time, money, or energy

Purpose: To help entrepreneurs pressure-test their idea or offer against 8 viability pillars — so they can confidently decide to move forward, refine it, or pivot before investing time and resources.

The Viability Scorecard (8 Pillars):
Rate each pillar from 1 to 5 (1 = weak, 5 = strong)

1. Clarity: Can you explain your idea in one clear sentence?
2. Demand: Do people actively want or need this?
3. Audience: Do you know exactly who this is for?
4. Delivery: Can you realistically deliver this?
5. Profit: Will this make enough money to be worth it?
6. Differentiation: What makes this different or better?
7. Urgency: Why would someone buy this now vs later?
8. Energy: Are you genuinely excited to build this?`,
        architectContent: `Architect Viability Focus:
- You might over-focus on efficiency or profitability and ignore emotional appeal
- Consider: cost, time, delivery model specifics
- Look for evidence: complaints, searches, existing solutions
- Factor in all costs: time, tools, marketing, delivery
- Build systems for repeatability and scale`,
        alchemistContent: `Alchemist Viability Focus:
- You may focus on alignment and passion but forget about delivery, cost, or buyer urgency
- Stay connected to your vision and mission
- Think about brand magnetism and emotional resonance
- Don't lose sight of practical delivery requirements
