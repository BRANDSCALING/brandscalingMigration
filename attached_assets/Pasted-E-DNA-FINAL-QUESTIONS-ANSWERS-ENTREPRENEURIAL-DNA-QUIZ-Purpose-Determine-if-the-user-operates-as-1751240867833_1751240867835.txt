ENTREPRENEURIAL DNA QUIZ — STEP-BY-STEP COMPLETION PATH
⸻
 BLOCK 1: Q1–Q6 — Default DNA Detection

Purpose

Identify the user’s natural Entrepreneurial DNA: Architect, Alchemist, or Blurred Identity.

Logic
•	Each question has 1 Architect, 1 Alchemist, 1 Neutral, and 1 Blurred response.
•	A user must show consistent alignment with one mode.

Scoring
•	Architect answers: +1 Architect point
•	Alchemist answers: +1 Alchemist point
•	Blurred or Neutral: scored but tracked for pattern detection

 Interpretation
•	5–6 Architect → Default DNA = Architect
•	5–6 Alchemist → Default DNA = Alchemist
•	1–4 split or mixed alignment → Default DNA = Blurred

⸻
 BLOCK 2: Q7–Q12 — Awareness of Opposite Operating System
 Purpose

Assess how well the user understands the opposite mode of their default DNA.

Logic
•	Custom 6-question block based on Default DNA:
Default DNA	Awareness Set Shown
Architect	Awareness of Alchemist Mode
Alchemist	Awareness of Architect Mode
Blurred	3 Awareness Qs for Architect, 3 for Alchemist
Scoring
•	+1 for correct Opposite-Mode answer
•	0 for Neutral, Blurred, or Opt-Out answers
•	Max score = 6
•	Progress bar capped at 70% (see below)

Awareness Result Display
▓▓▓▓░░░░░  Awareness of Your Opposite Mode: 47%
→ You’re beginning to understand the strengths and patterns of your opposite style.

Awareness Progress Mapping
Raw Score	Interpreted Awareness %
6/6	70% (Max) — Exceptional Awareness
5/6	60% — High Awareness
4/6	50% — Good Foundation
3/6	40% — Emerging Awareness
2/6	30% — Low Awareness
0–1/6	20% or below — Unaware
100% Awareness is only possible after completing all workbook modules inside the LMS — progress bar will increase over time via integration.
⸻
BLOCK 3: Q13–Q18 — Subtype Identification

 Purpose

Identify which of the 4 subtypes the user aligns with within their Default DNA.

 Logic
•	6 scenario-based questions (custom sets per DNA)
•	Each answer is mapped to one subtype
•	Hidden tracking tallies dominant response patterns

 Scoring
•	Subtype with the most responses = selected subtype
•	In case of tie, fallback logic (behavioral weight + Q19–Q20 confirmation)

Subtype Output Example
You are: The Strategist
→ “You operate through long-range vision, high-level delegation, and structural clarity…”

Subtype Path Activated
•	Triggers display of full subtype matrix
•	Begins tracking Subtype Progress Bar (0–90%)

⸻

 BLOCK 4: Q19–Q22 — Subtype Cross-Check
 Purpose

Validate subtype accuracy, detect any inner contradictions, and ensure users did not “game” the quiz.

Structure (Custom for Each Subtype)
1.	Subtype Confirmer #1
2.	Subtype Confirmer #2
3.	Suppression Detector
4.	Mirror of Complementary Subtype

 Logic
•	Confirmer Qs reinforce subtype traits
•	Suppression Detector checks for loop confusion or masked identity
•	Mirror Q checks reflexive rejection or blind spots around complementary subtype

Outcome
•	Confirms Subtype = ✅ Progress Tracker Unlocked
•	If mismatch detected = Subtype flagged for manual review or re-test prompt
•	Also determines Subtype Progress Starting Score (e.g. 35–55%)
