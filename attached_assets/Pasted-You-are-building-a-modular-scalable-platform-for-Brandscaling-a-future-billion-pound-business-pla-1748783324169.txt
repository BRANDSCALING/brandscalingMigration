You are building a modular, scalable platform for Brandscaling — a future billion-pound business platform that blends public-facing content, course delivery, community engagement, admin control, and future sandboxed modules like a Collaboration Club.

🧠 STRATEGIC GOALS:
• Support modular growth into LMS, community, AI agents, and more.
• Follow proper sandboxing rules — each major section (student, admin, community, collab club) must be isolated in its own UI and logic system.
• Enable role-based access to each part of the platform.
• Integrate Stripe for payments. Do NOT use GHL or any 3rd party funnel tools.

🛠️ BUILD STRUCTURE TO FIX & UPGRADE:

1. ✅ FIX CURRENT ERRORS:
• Remove duplicate “Sign Up” buttons — keep only a clean single Login/Signup path.
• Fix top menu: clicking the Brandscaling logo must return to homepage (only if the user role allows it — see logic below).
• Fix login flow: only switch menus and redirect after login is completed.
• Prevent logged-in users (students, admins) from seeing public site or each other’s UI.
• Add “Collaboration Club” button to website top menu — links to `/collab` page with a Coming Soon message.

2. 🔒 SANDBOXED STRUCTURE & HEADERS:
Each of these routes must be sandboxed and have their own UI, logic, and top headers:
• `/student` = LMS + course dashboard
• `/admin` = full admin panel
• `/community` = future forum/discussion portal (not yet live)
• `/collab` = future LinkedIn-style partner work zone (not yet live)

Each must:
• Live in separate route folders (e.g., frontend/pages/student/, /admin/, etc.)
• Use their own `Header` component and routing logic
• Never leak other headers into another section
• Be built as modules so they can scale independently

3. 🔐 ROLE-BASED ACCESS (Updated Logic):

ROLE MATRIX:
Role            | See Public Site | Click Brand Logo to Homepage | Notes
----------------|------------------|-------------------------------|------
Visitor         | ✅              | ✅                             | Standard
Student         | ❌              | ✅ if logged out               | Use logout confirmation popup
Admin           | ❌              | ⚠️ Optional                    | Only for QA/testing
Community       | ❌              | ⚠️ Optional sandbox-only       | Future
Collab Club     | ❌              | ⚠️ Optional sandbox-only       | Future

• All routing and header rendering must obey this matrix.
• Brandscaling logo should trigger redirect to homepage ONLY if public access is allowed for that role.
• Otherwise, redirect to their dashboard or logout popup.

4. 📚 STUDENT PORTAL FEATURES:
• Access to purchased courses and modules
• Access to digitized workbooks: users can fill answers, store responses, and get AI prompts for feedback
• Auto-detect incomplete answers → suggest filling gaps before expecting accurate feedback
• Instant guidance for areas like brand story, hooks, etc.
• Button to upgrade or purchase new programs

5. 💼 ADMIN PORTAL FEATURES:
• See/edit all content from website and LMS (blog, courses, lead magnets)
• Manage users, view quiz results, track payments (via Stripe)
• Control CRM flows and quiz logic (E-DNA)
• Only available to assigned Admin roles

6. 🧩 COMING SOON PAGES (LIVE NOW):
• Create `/collab` and `/community` pages with "Coming Soon" layout
• Accessible from public site via top menu link (Collab Club only)
• Must NOT link into student or admin systems

🛠️ TECH STACK:
• React frontend (modular folder structure)
• Node.js backend (Express)
• Firebase or PostgreSQL for auth/data
• Stripe integration for payments
• Use Role-Based Routing and Component Rendering
• Use React Context or Redux for auth/role state if needed

🎯 REMINDER:
You are not building a website.
You are building the infrastructure for the OS of the future entrepreneur — scalable, intentional, and never dependent on external platforms.

Now generate clean, bug-free code and folder structures that follow everything above, and run a full test on all routing, login, and header behaviors.
