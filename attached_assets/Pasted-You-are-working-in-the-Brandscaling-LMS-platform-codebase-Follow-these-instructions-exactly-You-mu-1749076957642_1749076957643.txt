OBJECTIVE:
Build the full Entrepreneurial DNA Quiz system. This includes:
1. Full React quiz with 12 real questions
2. Scoring logic to determine dominant type
3. Result screen at /quiz/result
4. API to save result to database
5. LMS course filtering based on result
6. Use Tailwind + Font = Poppins
7. Store result in both localStorage and the DB

---

‚úÖ FRONTEND:

### Route: `/quiz`

Render a 12-question multiple-choice quiz. Each question has exactly 4 options. Users select one option per question.

Each option is linked to one of 4 types:
- Architect üß±
- Alchemist üîÆ
- Undeclared üå´
- Blurred Identity ‚öñÔ∏è

When all 12 are answered:
- Count answers per type
- Determine dominant type (highest count)
- Store in `localStorage` as `quizResult`
- POST to `/api/quiz/submit` with `{ userId, result }`
- Navigate to `/quiz/result`

‚úÖ BACKEND:

1. **Create database table `user_dna_result`**
   - Fields: id, user_id (FK), result (text), completed_at (timestamp)
2. **API Route**: `POST /api/quiz/submit`
   - Body: `{ userId: string, result: string }`
   - Save or upsert DNA result for user

---

‚úÖ COURSE FILTERING:

- On `/courses`, read `?dna=[TYPE]` param
- Filter visible courses based on DNA tag match
- Use actual LMS logic and course metadata
- Also preload user‚Äôs DNA result (from DB) and auto-filter if not specified in URL

---

üîê FINAL RULES:
- No guessing
- No placeholder questions
- No fake routes or schemas
- Use actual routing, db setup, and course system already in place

If any required field or data is missing, STOP and return a list of what‚Äôs needed.
