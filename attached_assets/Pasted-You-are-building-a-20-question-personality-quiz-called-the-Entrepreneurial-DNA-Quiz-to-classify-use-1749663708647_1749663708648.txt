You are building a 20-question personality quiz called the Entrepreneurial DNA Quiz™ to classify users as one of the following types: Architect, Alchemist, or Blurred Identity. Each question has 4 answer choices: A, B, C, or D.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. FRONTEND:
- Use React and Tailwind for a clean mobile-first design.
- Create a question interface with a progress bar (20 steps).
- After Q6, show a temporary "Processing..." screen before continuing.
- At the end, display a full-screen Results page with:
    - Their Default Type (Architect / Alchemist / Blurred Identity)
    - Their Awareness % of the opposite type
    - Two progress bars side-by-side
    - Dynamic result text and CTA button

2. BACKEND:
- Use Node.js with Express.
- Create a scoring engine:
    - Q1–Q6 determine Default DNA
        - A = +1 Architect
        - B = +1 Alchemist
        - C or D = +1 Blurred
        - If Architect ≥ 4 → Architect
        - If Alchemist ≥ 4 → Alchemist
        - Else → Blurred Identity
    - Q7–Q12 measure Awareness:
        - Opposite of default = +1 Awareness
        - C or D = +0.5 Awareness
        - Awareness Score = sum of 6 → convert to %  
    - Q13–Q16 reinforce or conflict (use for logging, but not outcome override)

3. DATABASE:
- Use PostgreSQL or Firebase to store:
    - User ID
    - Answers to each question
    - Final DNA type
    - Awareness %
    - Timestamp
    - Retest lock (30-day cooldown logic)

4. RETEST RULES:
- After taking quiz, user cannot retake for 30 days.
- Show countdown timer on retest screen if accessed early.

5. OUTPUT COPY:
Use dynamic templates from these variables:
    - Default Type
    - Awareness %
    - Awareness-based CTA
    - Architect or Alchemist paragraph from the result copy

6. FUTURE EXPANSION READY:
- Design progress bar and user record to allow updates over time.
- Prepare placeholder hooks for increasing Awareness score as user completes frameworks or course modules.

Display with full responsiveness, keyboard accessibility, and dark mode toggle. Use a premium, clean UX tone with modern button feedback and smooth transitions.
