"Create Module 2 of the Smart Business Builderâ„¢ in a React + Node.js app. This module processes the userâ€™s 10-step wizard responses and generates a business model using GPT. Include frontend + backend logic:

---
### ðŸ”¹ Frontend (React + Tailwind)
- Create a component: `ModelOutputPanel.jsx`
- Add a **button** labeled: `\"Build My Model\"`
  - On click, send POST request to backend with:
```json
{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "dnaType": "Architect" or "Alchemist",
  "answers": [array of all 10 answers from wizard]
}
```
- While processing, show a loading spinner or message: `\"Building your custom business model...\"`
- When response returns, display the following sections:
  - **Business Model Summary** (formatted, 1-pager)
  - **Fixes & Warnings**
  - **Next Step Suggestions**
  - **Confidence Score (1â€“10)**
- Style sections using Tailwind:
  - Use Architect Indigo for labels/titles if DNA = Architect
  - Use Alchemist Orange for titles if DNA = Alchemist
  - Card layout or container with white background and spacing
- Include a `\"Save to Dashboard\"` and `\"Download PDF\"` button (PDF optional placeholder for now)

---
### ðŸ”¹ Backend (Node.js + Express + GPT API)
- Create a POST route: `/api/generate-model`
- Accept the request payload:
```json
{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "dnaType": "Architect" or "Alchemist",
  "answers": ["step1", ..., "step10"]
}
```
- Construct a prompt like:
> \"Based on the user's Entrepreneurial DNA type and their inputs, restructure the following business idea into a viable, simplified business model. Make recommendations for clarity, monetization, and ease of launch. Use a tone aligned to the DNA profile. Include: Audience, Problem, Solution, Offer, Delivery Model, Revenue Model, Cost Drivers, Unique Advantage, Launch Priority Steps. Also return: Warnings or Risks, Pivot/Improvement Suggestions, Confidence Level (1â€“10).\"
- Inject answers dynamically into prompt
- Use GPT API to generate structured response
- Return the structured output to frontend:
```json
{
  "model": "Full rewritten 1-page business model",
  "warnings": "Fixes or risk insights",
  "suggestions": "Next steps",
  "confidence": 8
}
```

---
### Folder Structure:
- Frontend: `/src/components/ModelOutputPanel.jsx`
- Backend: `/backend/routes/generateModel.js`

This module finalizes the Smart Business Builder by converting user input into a personalized, AI-enhanced business blueprint."
