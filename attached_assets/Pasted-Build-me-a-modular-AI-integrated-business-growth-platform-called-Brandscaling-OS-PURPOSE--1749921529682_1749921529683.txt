Build me a modular, AI-integrated business growth platform called **Brandscaling OS™**.

## PURPOSE:
This is a full-stack platform that guides entrepreneurs through personalized learning and growth based on their **Entrepreneurial DNA (E-DNA)** — either Architect (strategic) or Alchemist (creative). It must offer a public-facing website, a private user dashboard, LMS, AI agents, a gamified community, CRM, and admin control.

## FRONTEND SITE (built in Dora or React):
- SEO-optimized, scroll-animated homepage
- Pages:
  - Home (AI hero animation, CTA to Quiz + Mastermind)
  - Quiz (E-DNA Test)
  - Courses (Free/Paid, filtered by level)
  - Blog + Framework Library (searchable, Architect/Alchemist toggle)
  - AI Help (live preview of 2 AI agents)
  - Community (public thread preview)
  - Mastermind (high-ticket CTA)
  - Contact

## QUIZ ENGINE:
- 20-question E-DNA quiz
- Logic: Q1–6 = core type, Q7–12 = awareness of opposite, Q13–20 = validation
- Output = user type (Architect or Alchemist) + awareness %
- Redirect user to personalized dashboard
- Built in Lovable (MVP) and ported to Replit

## DASHBOARD (after login):
Tabs:
- Dashboard (user progress, AI prompts, next best step)
- AI Agents (choose Architect or Alchemist assistant)
- Courses & Frameworks (only purchased/unlocked clickable)
- Collab Club
- Community
- Events
- Affiliate Hub (only if unlocked)

## AI AGENTS:
- Two only: AI Architect & AI Alchemist
- Embedded across:
  - Dashboard
  - Courses (Ask-AI)
  - Community threads
  - Funnel/Offer builder
- Dual tone response logic:
  - Architect = structured, logical, bullet-point
  - Alchemist = visual, metaphorical, emotional

## LMS:
- Video + text + workbook + quiz + certificates
- Gamified (badges, streaks, leaderboard)
- Course access controlled by level + purchase + E-DNA
- Toggle Architect/Alchemist view of content

## COMMUNITY:
- Threads: Wins, Q&A, Feedback, Events
- Mastermind-only rooms
- Weekly digest email
- Auto-summarise long threads
- Role-based access

## ADMIN PANEL:
- Dashboard overview
- Courses/Frameworks
- User manager (levels + access)
- Funnels & automations
- Email campaigns
- AI prompt trainer
- Community moderation
- Affiliate invite manager
- System settings

## GAMIFICATION:
- Leaderboards
- Share-to-unlock content (e.g. “Invite 5 friends”)
- Social share tokens
- Affiliate only unlocked via email share, event attendance, or internal invite

## STACK & CONNECTIONS:

- Dora → visual public website
- Lovable → quiz logic (for now)
- Replit → app engine (full dashboard, LMS, CRM, community)
- Firebase → user auth
- PostgreSQL → database for users, courses, events, etc.
- Stripe → payment + webhook content unlock
- Resend → transactional & onboarding email delivery
- Calendly → taster days, coaching calls
- GHL → short-term CRM for funnels and nurture
- Internal Replit analytics → total users, course data, posts, completions

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Modular: changing quiz logic, email, or LMS shouldn’t affect other modules
- Fully responsive: mobile-first layout, app-ready
- Visual-first: hero animations, hover effects, storytelling UI
- AI-ready: all flows should support AI assistants with custom personas

Deliver:
- A working version of this platform at `app.brandscaling.com`
- Fully functioning E-DNA logic with dashboard-based personalization
- Locked/unlocked course content
- Community threads with moderation
- Admin panel with section-based permissions
- Share-to-unlock gamification and affiliate visibility rules
